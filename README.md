## Introduction
The project will create an interactive visualisation of a squirrel’s day-to-day life in New York City. The project is based on the 2018 and 2020 Squirrel Census, where the data from 2018 was collected over a two-week period and the data for 2020 was collected on a single day (01 March 2020) but simplified for the project as autumn and spring.[`Weather in New York`](https://www.newyork.com.au/travel-season-new-york/)

The project singles in on a specific animal but can be scaled to any wildlife and its interactions/ behaviours in similar metropolitan areas.

### Research Questions
1. How does the squirrel frequency and range of activities and behaviours compare between autumn and spring?

2. How does the squirrel population diversity (colours, age, location) compare between autumn and spring?

3. How do squirrels, in a park setting, interact with humans and other wildlife?


### Repository Structure


### Dataset
Retrieved data from the following two websites:
- [`The Squirrel Census`](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/data)
- [`2018 Central Park Squirrel Census - Squirrel Data`](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw)

## Scope

## Analysis
### Results
**Heatmap of Squirrels in New York 2018 and 2020**

The map below has various toggling layers that the user can drive to set specific parameters. The map can be used to highlight the various areas in which squirrels were sighted in either autumn or spring. It is important to note it can also be used to highlight the locations of all the squirrel activities can also be

**Bar Charts of Squirrels**

The bar chart displays Squirrel activity during Spring and autumn. The data is displayed as a percentage figure of total activities during the season.

**Heat Map for Appearance of Squirrels** 

The heatmap displays the frequency of squirrels based on fur colour. Cinnamon is the most common highlighted colour and grey is the primary colour.

**Pie chart for Interaction**

The pie chart illustrates four categories of squirrel behaviour, with the percentage of squirrels engaging in each behaviour. The largest category is "indifferent."

### Limitation
- Squirrels were not counted more than once, the scientific advisor onsite.
- 2020 data was limited to one day, whereas 2018 data was collected over a period
- 2018 data is limited to “Central Park”

## Future Research
- Locations: Map squirrel locations (location, specific location) and track squirrel vertical movements (above ground, etc).
